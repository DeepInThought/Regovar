REGOVAR is a collaborative, free and open source project of high-throughput sequencing data analysis software for gene panels, exome and genome (DPNI, SNV research, CNV, SV ...). It aims to involve and federate the different communities concerned (clinical geneticists, biologists and bioinformaticians), without institutional or geographical limits.
